Good ones, meaning ones that are viewed with pleasure, that are informative, that are understood by a wide audience but that still can be appreciated by connoisseurs.\nIt requires some training and knowledge of some principles but it is a skill that can be learned. And it’s not just idle chatter, I have proof. Since 2013 I’ve been teaching a Data Visualization Techniques course at the University of Warsaw and Warsaw University of Technology. During this time I’ve had the pleasure of working with hundreds of STEM students, most of whom were able to create amazing, clear, and often exceptional visualizations, right after learning about the rules of communication via plots.\nBased on the experience from these classes, Chart Runners were created. This is a collection of brief lectures on different aspects useful for better understanding, how communication with the use of statistical charts works. On the following pages, many analogies to preparing dishes will be presented because both in the kitchen, as well as when preparing statistical charts, you need practice, the knowledge of some basic principles, a bunch of trusted recipes, and lots of enthusiasm for experimentation. With this arsenal, any student of culinary arts is destined for success.\nDiscover the thrill and depth of crafting charts, making learning both insightful and enjoyable."

This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, the approach we prefer here is based on three foundations:\n\nShow the whole process. When working with data, it is very rare to use only one method or one trick. So showing how statistical thinking works should show the entire process of inference so that one can understand the context and the impact of the choices taken along the way from the begining to the final results.\nData analysis is fun. So learning how to do data analysis should be fun to! This can be achieved by using real data and current and interesting problems.\nPlay through these adventures yourself by messing with the data in your favorite software. All results presented should be completely reproducible so that the reader can try for themselves what would have happened if they had made different decisions in the data analysis process."

If so, the story ,,The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Responsible Machine Learning with code snippets in Python and R’’ is for you.\nOr maybe you are interested in the arcana of data visualization? Then you should read Charts Runners - a collection of short essays on how to visualize data, how not to do it, how to use ggplot2 package and what visual communication standards you can use.\nThe Chaos Game is for those interested in fractals. The three short stories will introduce both the characters of the three great mathematicians and allow you to learn the mathematical basis of fractals - geometric figures with properties not of this earth. The included codes in R, Python and Julia will allow you to draw fractals yourself in any of these languages."
