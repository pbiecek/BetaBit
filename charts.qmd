## About

How to create good plots? Good ones, meaning ones that are viewed with pleasure, that are informative, that are understood by a wide audience but that still can be appreciated by connoisseurs.

It requires some training and knowledge of some principles but it is a skill that can be learned. And it’s not just idle chatter, I have proof. Since 2013 I’ve been teaching a Data Visualization Techniques course at the University of Warsaw and Warsaw University of Technology. During this time I’ve had the pleasure of working with hundreds of STEM students, most of whom were able to create amazing, clear, and often exceptional visualizations, right after learning about the rules of communication via plots.

Based on the experience from these classes, Chart Runners were created. This is a collection of brief lectures on different aspects useful for better understanding, how communication with the use of statistical charts works. On the following pages, many analogies to preparing dishes will be presented because both in the kitchen, as well as when preparing statistical charts, you need practice, the knowledge of some basic principles, a bunch of trusted recipes, and lots of enthusiasm for experimentation. With this arsenal, any student of culinary arts is destined for success.

Discover the thrill and depth of crafting charts, making learning both insightful and enjoyable.

## Fully reproducible code snippets
